# Weekly Tasks - Programming and Scripting Module

This repository contains the weekly tasks for the **Programming and Scripting** module, part of the **Science in Computing (Data Analytics)** course at **Atlantic Technological University (ATU)**.

## **About the Module**
The Programming and Scripting module aims to build foundational programming skills, focusing on problem-solving through Python. It covers essential concepts like data structures, functions, control flow, and practical applications for data analytics.

## **Tasks Overview**
Each task is designed to reinforce programming concepts and encourage hands-on practice. The tasks progressively increase in complexity, allowing for continuous skill development.

Example topics include:
- **Basic Python syntax and operations**
- **Loops and conditionals**
- **Working with data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)**
- **File handling**
- **Data analysis with libraries like pandas and matplotlib**

## **How to Use This Repository**
